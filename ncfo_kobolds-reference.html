<p>Resolve the roll:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, your attack connects and you deal your damage.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, your attack connects, but you are off-balance and exposed; deal ½ your damage rounded down and the GM will tell you who takes advantage of your position.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="duck-cover-and-squirm">Duck, Cover, and Squirm</h2>
<p>When you <strong>avoid immediate danger</strong>, describe how you do so.</p>

<li>If you do so by taking it on the chin, roll+﻿CON.</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolve the roll:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, you do what you set out to do, and the threat doesn’t come to bear.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="wit-and-verve">Wit and Verve</h2>
<p>When you try to <strong>lie or fast talk yourself out of a situation without offering anything in return</strong> roll +﻿INT.</p>

<li>What is about to try and kill us, besides everything?</li>
<li>What can we see that others would miss?</li>
<li>How can I escape?</li>
<li>Where is the shiny?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plead-your-case">Plead Your Case</h2>
<p>When you attempt to <strong>plead your case to non-kobolds</strong>, roll +﻿CHA.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, they listen long enough for you to offer them a deal; you might not get everything you want, but you’ll get some of what you need.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, they’re openly aggressive, and you’ll need to sweeten the pot for them to even consider what you’re offering.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1 id="village">Village</h1>
<h2 id="starting-moves">Starting Moves</h2>
<h3 id="recruit">Recruit</h3>
<p>When you <strong>recruit additional kobolds</strong> to help with a task, give an inspiring speech and roll +﻿Teamwork.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, you get two units of kobolds.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you get one unit of kobolds.</li>
<li>On a miss the villagers lack of faith in you is demoralizing. All players take -2 to their next move in combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you take units from the village, reduce your population respectively—one unit equals one population—until you bring those units back to the village. Starting Kobold Units deal 1d6 +﻿Warfare damage and have ten (10) hit points.</p>
<h3 id="breed">Breed</h3>
<p>When at least one kobold <strong>returns from a mission and shares the vital resources obtained</strong>, your village enters a breeding period; reset an appropriate want clock and roll +﻿Hardiness.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, add 1d6 to your population.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, add 1d6 to your population, but add a new want.</li>
<li>On a miss, the distraction of the breeding season has opened you up to disaster! The GM immediately brings an external pressure to bear on the village.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="runaway">Runaway!!</h3>
<p>When your village is <strong>raided by murderous outsiders</strong>, roll +﻿Secrecy.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, the raiders weren’t able to locate any of your villagers; no population is lost!</li>
<li>On a 7–9, the raiders found some of your villagers, but didn’t find your main village! Subtract 1d6 from your village population.</li>
<li>On a miss, the murderhobos find your village and slaughter your people; lose 2d6 population.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stockpiles">Stockpiles!</h3>
<p>When at least one kobold <strong>returns from a mission and hoards vital resources instead of sharing them</strong>, roll +﻿Ingenuity.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, the village gains three stockpile hold.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, the village gains two stockpile hold.</li>
<li>On a miss, the hoarding causes a backlash among the villagers, tick a single want clock twice, player’s choice. No matter what, no want clocks are reset and the village does not Breed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-village-moves-7xp">Advanced Village Moves: 7XP</h2>
<h3 id="a-bit-of-the-ultra-violence">A Bit of the Ultra-Violence</h3>
<p>Your kobolds have grown up extra violent! They deal an additional 1d4 damage <strong>when attacking from melee</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="band-together">Band Together</h3>
<p>When you <strong>huddle together for defense during combat</strong>, roll +﻿Warfare.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, all kobolds involved gain +﻿1 armor for the rest of combat.</li>
<li>On a 7–9. all kobolds involved gain +﻿1 armor until a kobold champion falls.</li>
<li>On a miss, your cowardice wastes precious time, allowing enemy reinforcements to arrive!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bounty-of-the-will">Bounty of the Will</h3>
<p>By working together, your village is able to alleviate some want. For every two want clocks you reset, roll +﻿Teamwork.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+ you may reduce a single additional want clock by three segments.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you may reduce a single additional want clock by two segments.</li>
<li>On a miss, your utter mismanagement of the natural resources surrounding the village puts you in a bind. Choose a want clock and increase it by one segment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fuck-you-we-have-a">Fuck You, We Have a…</h3>
<p>Your village gains a mighty protector! Of course, they want something in return…</p>
<p>This move can be taken multiple times, but only in the order listed below. These sorts of creatures aren’t known for sharing; each time a new creature moves into your territory they run off the previous protector (and you no longer have to fulfill the previous protector’s wants). Thus, you can only have one protector at a time. You may spend additional xp to skip protector levels, e.g. 14xp to go straight to Troll, 21xp to go straight to Necromancer.</p>
<h4 id="wizard">…Wizard!</h4>
<p>A wizard of some variety has taken up residence in your village! What sort of wizard is it? Gain four 1d6 damage, 10 hit point homunculi units for future raids. Add a new want to the village. Describe what it is and where it can be acquired.</p>
<h4 id="troll">…Troll!</h4>
<p>A mighty troll has taken up residence in the village! What’s its name? Gain one 1d12 damage, 20 hit point troll unit that regenerates three hit points per round. Add a new want to the village. Describe what it is and where it can be acquired.</p>
<h4 id="necromancer">…Necromancer!</h4>
<p>A terrible necromancer has taken up residence in your village! Gain five 1d6 damage, 8 hit point skeleton units. Gain 2 additional units each time your village breeds. Add a new want to the village. Describe what it is and where it can be acquired.</p>
<h4 id="dragon">…Dragon!</h4>
<p>A mighty dragon has taken up residence in your village! What sort of dragon is it? Gain one 2d8 damage, 40 hit point dragon unit. Add a new want to the village. Describe what it is and where it can be acquired.</p>
<p>If any unit gained by this move dies, the unit is gone forever. You may, however, still buy the next level protector. If a protector leaves the village for any reason, their want goes with them. You don’t have to find rotten fish to feed to your troll protector if he’s been killed by a murderhobo.</p>
<h3 id="hardy-kobolds">Hardy Kobolds</h3>
<p>Your kobold champions are hardier than other kobolds. They roll 2d6 (instead of 1d6) and keep the highest d6 for their hit points! At that point you’re basically a tank! All active kobold champions may re-roll their hit points when this move is initially taken.</p>
<h3 id="kobold-healers">Kobold Healers!</h3>
<p>Somehow you’ve passed down a few medicinal remedies from generation to generation! There are now healers in your village. When you return to your village after a mission and seek relief, roll +﻿Ingenuity.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, your healers make workable salves and ointments for your wounds; all player characters may set their hit points to max.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, your healers have a few odds and ends that might offer relief; all player characters may set their hit points to max-2.</li>
<li>On a miss, your healers have very little in the way of supplies; all PCs may set their hit points to max-3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kobold-riders">Kobold Riders</h3>
<p>Your Kobolds are now mounted warriors! Describe what your kobolds ride and how they domesticated these beasts. Your kobold champions always succeed when you try to escape combat. Add a pressure to describe the beasts that prey on your domesticated animals.</p>
<h3 id="sapper-units">Sapper Units</h3>
<p>You now have the ability to recruit sapper unit kobolds as well as regular kobold units. When you roll recruit, determine how many units you want to be sappers and how many you want to be normal units (up to the total allowed by the recruit move). These suicidal units deal 1d6 damage and have 8 hit points as well as the move EXPLOSIVES! Any champion kobold can trigger the EXPLOSIVES! move: the sapper unit deals 1d10 damage to all near units, including allies and player characters.</p>
<h3 id="stronger-together">Stronger Together</h3>
<p>Once per combat any number of PCs may join together as a unit for up to three rounds. The players now attack as one unit dealing 1d12 +﻿ number PCs involved in damage. Any damage taken by the unit is spread evenly amongst the PCs in the unit. The unit is dissolved after three rounds or as soon as one of the PCs dies.</p>
<h3 id="village-fortifications">Village Fortifications</h3>
<p>Your village has erected fortifications that minimize population damage when the village is raided. Whenever your village is attacked you may roll your population loss twice and take the lower result.</p>
<h3 id="village-improvements">Village Improvements</h3>
<p>You may increase a single village stat by +﻿1 (max +﻿2). This move may only be taken once. Tell the GM what your kobolds do to improve their village.</p>
<h3 id="wellspring">Wellspring</h3>
<p>You’ve uncovered a magical totem in your village. What is it? All kobold champions immediately gain +﻿1 to any single stat. This move can only be taken once.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-village-moves-7xp-1">Advanced Village Moves: 7XP</h2>
<p>Any move marked with “*” becomes a basic move for all Kobolds.</p>
<h3 id="higher-education">Higher Education</h3>
<p>All kobolds immediately gain +﻿1 ability. Each subsequent generation now gains 2+﻿WIS abilities in addition to their one inherited ability.</p>
<h3 id="hive-mind">Hive Mind</h3>
<p>The kobolds are now able to share simple thoughts and feelings. Whenever a kobold is in the company of other kobolds and would roll +﻿INT, they may now roll +﻿Ingenuity instead. This ability has a distinct visual affect, explain what it is and how others react to it.</p>
<h3 id="kobold-rage">Kobold Rage<sup>*</sup></h3>
<p>When you unleash your kobold rage and charge an enemy unit, roll +﻿Warfare.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, your rage is ferocious and true…but you also become reckless; gain +﻿2 to STR and -2 to CON for five rounds.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, it seems like you’re pretty upset and very reckless! Gain +﻿1 to STR and -2 to CON for five rounds. You cannot unleash your rage again until the next mission.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-words-have-power">Some Words Have Power<sup>*</sup></h3>
<p>Some thoughts have a certain sound, that being the equivalent to a form. Through sound and motion, you are able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy, burst his organs…or something. Probably just the paralyze thing. Speak the words and roll +﻿Hardiness!</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, you speak a power word and add the paralyzed tag to target unit.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you speak a power word and add the paralyzed tag to target unit and choose 2:
<ul>
<li>You draw unwanted attention.</li>
<li>You take 1d4 damage from the strain of the word.</li>
<li>You are knocked back and fall prone.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spot-me-bro.">Spot Me, Bro.</h3>
<p>The kobolds have learned to work well together when attempting feats of strength thanks to excellent coaching by the elder kobolds. Whenever a kobold is in the company of other kobolds and would roll +﻿STR, they may now roll +﻿Warfare instead.</p>
<h3 id="ten-mouths-are-better-than-one">Ten Mouths are Better Than One</h3>
<p>The kobolds of your village have learned to play off each other’s lies and pleas, making you all more convincing as a group. Whenever a kobold is in the company of other kobolds and would normally roll +﻿CHR, they may now roll +﻿Teamwork instead. All PCs should explain how they’re helping the current player’s kobold. What form does your help take and what complications might it add if this whole thing fails?</p>
<h3 id="wonderkobold-powers-combine">Wonderkobold Powers Combine<sup>*</sup></h3>
<p>When you enlist a friendly unit to aid you in your efforts, roll +﻿Teamwork. On a 10+﻿, take +﻿3 to your next roll as they come to your aid. On a 7–9, take +﻿1 to your roll, but the unit is exposed to danger and suffers 1d6 damage from a nearby enemy unit.</p>
<h1 id="attributes">Attributes</h1>
<h2 id="backstab">Backstab</h2>
<p>When you attack from concealment, deal +﻿2 damage.</p>
<h2 id="big-ass-sword">Big Ass Sword</h2>
<p>You have learned to fight with an enormous sword! You deal 1d8+﻿STR damage on a successful attack, thanks to your big ass sword.</p>
<h2 id="bless">Bless</h2>
<p>You can bless yourself, another kobold, or a friendly unit, increasing the chances that they survive a skrimish.</p>
<p>When you call upon your gods to bless someone, roll +﻿WIS.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a hit, the gods smile upon you; your target takes +﻿1 ongoing to Attack for the rest of the battle.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, your target takes +﻿1 forward, but the glow surrounding them makes them a target for unwanted attention!</li>
<li>On a miss, your god laughs at your feeble attempt to curry favor and punishes you with a curse for your insolence!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="born-to-be-a-ninja">Born to be a Ninja</h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Ninjas….Sort Of or Born to be a Ninja</em></p>
<p>Your parents have taught you the way of the ninja: you always do your full damage. When you make a successful Attack, roll your damage die twice and take the highest total. Do not divide by two on a 7–9.</p>
<h2 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h2>
<p>You have the following magical abilities: Light, Unseen Servant, and Prestidigitation (DUNGEON WORLD, PP. 152). These can manifest in whatever way you and the GM agree seems appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="channel-magic">Channel Magic</h2>
<p>Kobold magic is a bit…odd. Because of their short lifespans, kobolds have never mastered true control over magical forces. Instead they rely on a sort of wild elemental magic that can have some…unintended consequences.</p>
<p>When you channel kobold magic, describe the element you are channeling and the desired effect; roll +﻿INT.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a hit, the channeling works as intended, dealing 2d6+﻿INT damage if appropriate.</li>
<li>On a 7–9 the channeling works, but choose 1:
<ul>
<li>You draw unwanted attention.</li>
<li>The channeling is taxing; take 1d4 damage.</li>
<li>The channeling works but has unintended consequences, the GM will tell you what.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On a miss, take 1d6 damage as the channeling backfires and magic pulses through your body!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="command">Command</h2>
<p>Once per combat, you may summon a demon or spirit unit to do your bidding. Perform the ritual necessary and roll +﻿CHR. On a hit, you summon a creature from another plane or realm.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, take 3 hold.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, take 1 hold.</li>
</ul>
<p>The summoned unit is only partially in this world and therefore has no damage score, but it does have 12 hit points. Spend a hold, 1 for 1, to do any of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>The summoned unit aids in an Attack, adding +﻿2 to your roll and damage.</li>
<li>The summoned unit absorbs the damage from a single attack.</li>
<li>The summoned unit scouts ahead as if it has the Scout ability.</li>
<li>The summoned unit enchants and distracts another unit. That unit will focus solely on the spirit.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a miss, your summoning works…but the summoned creature is beyond your control and furious that you have tried to enslave it!</p>
<h2 id="confounding-performance">Confounding Performance</h2>
<p>You play an instrument…and get real weird with it.</p>
<p>When you play a song of kobold battle to intimidate a target unit, roll +﻿CHA.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, you or your allies take +﻿2 forward to the next Attack on the target unit.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you or your allies take +﻿1 forward to the next Attack on the target unit.</li>
<li>On a miss, your performance is so unsettling that nearby enemies immediately converge on you, desperately trying to stop your performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cure">Cure</h2>
<p>You can heal another by laying on your hands. Roll +﻿WIS.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a hit, you heal 1d6+﻿WIS.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you absorb some of the wounds yourself, taking 1/2 the amount of damage healed, rounded up.</li>
<li>On a miss, something has gone terribly wrong; did you read that incantation right? You feel searing pain in your hands, and take 1d4 damage from the failed attempt!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="even-bigger-ass-sword">Even Bigger Ass Sword</h2>
<p><em>Prerequisite: Big Ass Sword or Even Bigger Ass Sword</em></p>
<p>Your parents have taught you how to wield a really big ass sword! You deal 1d10 damage on a successful attack, thanks to your really big ass sword.</p>
<h2 id="hardy">Hardy</h2>
<p>Take +﻿3 HP. Good luck!</p>
<h2 id="if-i-cant-see-them">If I Can’t See Them…</h2>
<p>When you stay perfectly still to avoid detection, roll +﻿CHA.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, you become effectively invisible through the use of clever camouflage and showmanship. You stay invisible until you do something to draw attention to yourself.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you become invisible, but you must remain completely still to avoid detection.</li>
<li>On a miss, your efforts at camouflage make you stick out like a sore thumb. You immediately draw the attention of nearby enemies.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lucky">Lucky</h2>
<p>Once per mission, you may count a miss as a 7–9.</p>
<h2 id="ninjassort-of">Ninjas…Sort Of</h2>
<p>You’ve mastered the kobold martial arts, allowing you to make multiple attacks at once and increasing your effectiveness…sort of. When you make a successful Attack, roll your damage die twice and use the higher result.</p>
<h2 id="pet">Pet</h2>
<p>You have a loyal and effective animal companion. When you fight with your animal companion, take +﻿1 ongoing to Attack.</p>
<h2 id="reflexes">Reflexes</h2>
<p>At the start of combat, roll +﻿DEX.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+﻿, you hold 3.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend 1 hold during the combat to negate damage from a single attack directed toward you (after rolling the damage).</li>
<li>On a miss, you’ve overplayed your hand and your reflexes have gotten the better of you. Your sweet moves have put you out in front of your friends, leaving you exposed and vulnerable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scout">Scout</h2>
<p>When you scout ahead, you always spot the target before they spot you.</p>
<h2 id="sharpshooter">Sharpshooter</h2>
<p>You have excellent aim and always hit the most vulnerable parts of your enemies. You gain +﻿2 damage when using a ranged weapon.</p>
<h2 id="slay">Slay</h2>
<p>You inflict an additional +﻿2 melee damage on a successful Attack.</p>
<h2 id="thieves-fingers">Thieves Fingers</h2>
<p>You’ve picked up a few tricks that allow you to pick pockets and get those hard to reach items.</p>
<p>When you go for a score, roll +﻿INT.</p>
<ul>
